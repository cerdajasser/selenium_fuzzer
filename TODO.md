# TODO: Selenium Fuzzer Project Improvements

## 1. ~~Improved Error and Exception Handling~~
- ~~**Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism if certain elements (e.g., buttons or dropdowns) are not found immediately, which could be useful for dynamic web pages.~~
- ~~**Graceful Exit**: Improve the handling of exceptions to ensure that when an error occurs, the script gracefully quits and outputs helpful debug information.~~

## 2. Parallelization for Efficiency
- [ ] **Parallel Browsing**: Utilize threading or asynchronous code to run multiple instances of fuzzing in parallel, which will reduce the time required for fuzzing large websites.
- [ ] **Distributed Fuzzing**: Create an option for distributed fuzzing by running multiple instances of the fuzzer on different machines, sharing results in a central repository.

## 3. Comprehensive Reporting and Log Analysis
- [ ] **Detailed HTML Reports**: Enhance the reporting mechanism to generate HTML reports summarizing vulnerabilities discovered during fuzzing, including screenshots and payloads used.
- [ ] **Log Aggregation and Analysis**: Develop a script to aggregate and analyze log files to help identify patterns or common errors found during fuzzing.

## 4. ~~State Tracking and JavaScript Detection Improvements~~
- ~~**JavaScript Event Analysis**: Improve the JavaScript change detector by integrating browser DevTools to capture network activity, analyze JavaScript events, and detect anomalous behavior.~~
- ~~**Stateful Fuzzing**: Implement state tracking by taking snapshots of the webpage's state and comparing them after fuzzing. This will help detect changes and unexpected behaviors, such as page redirects or content modifications.~~

## 5. Coverage Enhancement
- [ ] **DOM Traversal**: Expand the project to traverse the DOM and interact with elements deeper in the hierarchy, including dynamically loaded elements or hidden elements that can be made visible using JavaScript.
- [ ] **File Upload Handling**: Add functionality to detect and fuzz file upload fields by providing different types of file payloads to test for file-based vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Iframe Handling**: Enhance the project to detect and interact with iframes, as they are often used by web applications and may contain additional input fields.

## 6. Machine Learning for Adaptive Fuzzing
- [ ] **Adaptive Payload Selection**: Use machine learning to adjust payloads based on the responses received from the website. This would help in crafting more intelligent and targeted payloads based on observed behavior.
- [ ] **Input Classification**: Implement a classifier that can automatically detect input field types (such as email, text, number, etc.) and generate appropriate payloads accordingly.

## 7. Enhanced User Interaction
- [ ] **Interactive Mode for Exploration**: Implement an interactive mode where users can visually interact with the page (via CLI or GUI) to indicate which fields should be fuzzed or how specific elements should be interacted with.
- [ ] **Field Relationship Management**: Add logic to manage dependent fields, such as selecting a value in one dropdown influencing the values available in others. This would involve dynamically detecting dependencies and adjusting fuzzing accordingly.
